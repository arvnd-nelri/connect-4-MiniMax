# About the Project

1. Graphical Version (count4connect.py): A GUI-based version using Pygame. Players can choose difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard), and play against an AI using the Minimax algorithm with adjustable depth. It features a visually appealing wooden-texture background, real-time rendering, and highlights for player and AI moves.

2. Terminal Version (connect_four_terminals.py): A text-based version playable in the terminal. It offers the same gameplay mechanics as the graphical version, including AI-powered moves, making it accessible for systems without graphical support.

Both implementations record game results, including move history, AI depth, and winner, in a Results.txt file with timestamps.
